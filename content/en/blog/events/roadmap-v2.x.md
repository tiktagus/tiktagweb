  TikTag v2.x focuses on marketplaces and commerce features.

> TiTag v2.x will enable us to go GA (Generally Available) with features to support validated marketplace and commerce design.

## Planned Features

- Try and validate features that support face-to-face engagement among users, such as those used in off-line trade-shows, art spaces/metaver show-rooms and/or offices;
- Enable APIs for IoT devices, such as barcode/QR/NFC sensing, extending TikTag to more use cases.
